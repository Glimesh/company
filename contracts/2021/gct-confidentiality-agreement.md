`Revision: 2021-01-27`

**Privacy & Security Officer:** Luke Strickland

Glimesh, Inc. takes the privacy of users' personal information very seriously and as a volunteer to the Glimesh Community Team (“GCT”) we ask that you uphold the same level of commitment to keeping our valued community’s personal information safe and secure.

In order for you to become a member of the Glimesh Community Team (“GCT”) we ask that you understand and agree with the terms in this document. Please take great care to completely read and understand this document as privacy is a very important matter. By signing this document you are acknowledging that you understand your responsibilities to user privacy and that you will follow good practices to keep that information safe and secure.

Any reference to “GCT” in this agreement is a reference to the Glimesh Community Team.

# What is covered
As a member of the Glimesh Community Team you will have access not only to user’s private information through the GCT Dashboard but also there will be scenarios where information will be shared with you that should be kept private. Examples would be ban reasons, personal information shared by a streamer, streamer emergency contact information, and sensitive information around issues. The purpose of this document is to help you understand what information should be private, give examples of safe practices for keeping that information safe, and to give you direction and instruction on how to handle that information.

# What information is private?
Sometimes information can be difficult to determine if it is private information or not. Asking yourself these questions can help determine if information is private and should not be shared
-   Is the person sharing the information saying its private
-   Is the information labeled as confidential
-   Is the information protected behind a password protected location, including but not limited to the GCT Dashboard
-   Could the information impact someone (positive or negatively) when shared without permission
-   Does the information grant access to someone’s account
-   Did the conversation happened in a private channels
-   Is the information personal in nature, some examples include:
	-   Name
	-   Birthdate
	-   Address
	-   Relatives Information
	-   Pictures of individual or relatives
	-   Contact Information
	-   Pay Information
	-   Stream Metrics
	-   Email
	-   User ID

While this is not an all inclusive list if any of the information you are handling falls under these categories then it is most likely private information that needs to be protected. If you have any questions about information please contact your Manager or the Privacy & Security Officer.

# How should you handle Private Information?
As a member of the Glimesh Community Team we ask that keeping private information private would be a high priority of yours. We ask that you adopt some safe practices in order to keep your account secure and information secure.
-   You must use 2FA on your account. This extra layer of security will ensure that your account cannot be accessed as easily which could potentially compromise information.
-   Never share your account login or information with anyone.
-   Do not discuss any private information with anyone except those directly involved. This includes other members of the GCT who are not involved directly with the situation, family, and friends.
-   Do not stream or broadcast while moderating.
-   When you do stream please make sure that all screens with private information are closed.
-   Be mindful of other areas that may contain private information as well including direct messages or conversations on Discord in channels set aside for moderation. Please make sure that if you stream none of these are open during the stream.
-   Do not use your Glimesh moderation account on shared computers.
    
If you were to find that you may have accidentally leaked information, or you believe information has been leaked by you, or another member of the community it is your responsibility to report as soon as possible to your Manager and Privacy & Security Officer. Failure to do so could result in information spreading further than it should and the sooner we can stop the leak the better.

When sharing any information that is private the only acceptable times are when
-   You have clear indication that information can be shared. Any approval to share private information should be recorded in writing and should not be a verbal indication only.
-   The information has become public through authorized means.    
-   You are sharing information with a Manager or a Privacy & Security Officer.
    

# How long is this Agreement?
Your obligation to keep users’ private information confidential lasts as long as the information is private. There will be no end to that commitment in keeping that information confidential and secure.

There will be a renewal of this document yearly, or when there are changes made to it. When that happens you will be asked to resign the document. This is solely for the purpose of confirming your intention to follow the details outlined in this document. If you no longer want access to private information you can remove yourself from this agreement but you will still be responsible to keep private information you know safe, secure, and private.

If you don’t renew this document you will be removed from the GCT, all communications, and any pages that have private information. If you still have access to that information through private messages, screenshots, or other means you are still obligated to keep that information private.

If you receive any private information after removing yourself from this agreement or not renewing your agreement you must let the individual sending you the information that you are no longer to receive that information, or if you still have access to private information through the site please let a Manager or a Privacy & Security Officer know.
