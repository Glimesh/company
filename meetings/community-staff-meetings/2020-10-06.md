## Minutes
-   Sorry we missed you last week ‘sad face’
-   Don’t have a real objective, just want to show off what’s happened in the past two weeks    
-   NOTE: Metrics show growth over 2 weeks, not one week. We’ve grown a lot on twitter and website visits by a new “branch” (when a new person discovers us and we see a huge spike in growth we call it “branching”)
-   Starting to solidify the API, working on remainder of ‘writes’
-   New page on the website for us to publish live metrics
	-   User Growth
	-   Live Streams
-   We’re now actually processing payments through Glimesh! We’ve started testing out the functionality with a few members of the contributors team. 12 successful subscriptions with 8 test users.
	-   About 4 steps to link bank account & verify identity to set up subscriptions!
	-   Can’t subscribe to yourself
	-   These numbers will continue to be public
-   We’re very focused on privacy. We aren’t using any Facebook, Google, or Amazon services to power Glimesh. We’re using only privacy focused providers.
-   Redesigned registration page for better mobile experience and accessibility
	-   Screen will resize to different view ports to make it more usable
	-   There are now elements that screenreaders can use to identify the fields to you if you need that assistance
-   Community team is looking for more bilingual individuals. If you are bilingual or know someone who is that would be interested in joining the Community Team, reach out to Paco1342 in discord
-   Clone and I are very sore and tired from moving, but we did it!
-   We have some new animated emotes, check out the #design channel in the discord to see them!
-   We tested linking bank accounts in foreign countries and Stripe adjusted the form to what the user needed and took only a few minutes to complete. We have not tested payouts yet.
-   May have to withhold up to 30% of income from streamers who are in a country that doesn’t have a tax treaty for clear tax agreement with the United States. You would get it back at the end of the year via a tax return, but we’re still working to figure this out.
