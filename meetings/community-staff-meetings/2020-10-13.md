Ideal Launch:
1.  Always someone live

3.  Core moderation team
4.  Diverse streaming types
    
## Minutes
-   Our tweet asking what y’all will stream on day one got us the most impressions we’ve had to date!
-   Clone getting back into the swing of development after our move
-   Chat bugs have been fixed! Chat scrolls now! But we did make a few bugs that we’re working on
-   Pop up chat is here! Our next step is to be able to remove the background for…..reasons
-   Glimojis are SVGs so they’ll scale with the size of your computer screen
-   We used to have static, hard coded stream keys but now keys will go through the service to make sure that the streamer is the right streamer for that account
-   Thumbnail generation is very near done! These will be generated every few seconds
-   The meta data we’re tracking now will allow us to tell you some really cool numbers about your stream after your done (packet loss, packet negotiation, stream time, average number of viewers)
-   MJA demos the GCT dashboard!
-   Our website roadmap is different from the roadmap we’re showing off in this meeting. The roadmap from this meeting are the actual items we need to complete before we can launch, the one on the website is our overall product roadmap.
-   We got a lot of push back from the community that they don’t want email notifications for going live
-   Our biggest focus right now across all areas is scalability
