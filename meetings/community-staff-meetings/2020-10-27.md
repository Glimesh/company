## Meeting Minutes:
1.  Fun Fact. Pixelchat brings in just as much traffic and users as Twitter does.
2.  Live demo of KJBot!
3.  Check out our new FAQ page to get all the details from our town hall last week.
4.  We’ll hopefully be launching channel customization this week!
5.  Heiwa reviews proposal for Glimesh Browser
	1.  Linnaeus classification model (start broad, drill down)
	2.  Preview of JustSimy’s mocks up for potential solution
	3.  Benefit of this method is to give other non gaming categories a better chance at discoverability
	4.  Minimum 1 tag, maximum 1 tags
	5.  Can potentially aggregate popular tags and show them at the top for quick click buttons
	6.  Shouldn’t have to use multiple tags for the same game
	7.  Allow freedom and equality for everyone, other non-gaming categories will now get the opportunity to be more specific in their stream categorization
	8.  This will be entirely community driven
	9.  Implementing this is still a bit of work that we have to weigh and consider
	10.  Downside: it'll be a bit of a learning curve for some streamers
	11.  Will make charity streams more visible
	12.  Should tags be separate from the stream title?
