## Challenges
-   Lack of information around foreign tax and legal obligations, re: payout -- we’re starting to learn more about this, may be able to support Canada & UK on launch!


## Agenda
1.  Review Metrics, Wins, & Challenges
2.  Clone to give roadmap review on items needed for launch.
    
Ideal Launch:
1.  Always someone live
2.  Strong community values
3.  Core moderation team
4.  Diverse streaming types
    
    
## Minutes
-   We’ve had a slow week in terms of growth, but we think that’s okay
-   Our user base is getting really large! Over 2,000 people will be getting an email the day we go live!
-   Next functionality step with OAuth will be allowing you to update your stream name for example.
-   Can’t buy the merchandise yet...sorry, but it’ll come very soon!
-   Paco anticipates inviting some members to the community team within the next week.
-   If you’re interested in translating the platform, reach out to mja000!
-   We discovered a new thing for the FTL test stream called Mountains (thanks Paco!)
-   Showed off our API code live on the stream! Documentation for the API is on Github.
-   Unveil the roadmap!
    
	-   Broken down into three different branches/teams
	-   We’ll turn on subscriptions about 2 weeks before launch. Streamers will be able to go in and set up their accounts so they can be set up for payouts on day 1
	-   Need to make our emails look less spammy
	-   Need to establish an api internally to communicate streamkeys
	-   If you’re interested in working on FTL and have a background in C++, networks, like pushing bits around, come find Hayden in the discord!
	-   After 400+ hours...FTL decided to die the moment we talked about it
	-   Design goes hand in hand with all the other features to make sure we have a consistent look and feel
	-   The 2 weeks before launch will be the busiest time of our lives getting prepared, but it’ll all be worth it
