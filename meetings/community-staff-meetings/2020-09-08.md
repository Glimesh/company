## Minutes
-   Welcome to the 7th meeting!
-   Some weeks are heavy on social media, some are heavy on development work. The past few weeks have been dev heavy weeks.
-   WE ARE OFFICIALLY RUNNING ON OUR OWN FTL IMPLEMENTATION!
-   We’re actually streaming to Glimovies and the Staff meeting at the same time!
-   TOS Review - we are so pleased and happy with the respectfulness of the community while discussing the Terms of Service.
-   Quick video preview of our merch test prints! We still have a little way to go before we can actually sell them, but we are still so excited!
-   HUGE thank you to the community for being amazing! Clone has never felt this way about a start-up or project before and we think we’re going to be a differentiator in the industry because of our community. We <3 y’all!
-   When we are 2 weeks out from launch, Clone would like to shift focus from dev work to wrapping up loose ends, getting more countries supported, etc.
-   Glimesh Community Team - Paco is reviewing applications now and writing out a handbook for onboarding the community team members.
-   Take it away Carmy & Bubdrum for the design segment!
	-   All artists and creators granted permission for their work to be used in the presentation
	-   Bubdrum presents Style Sheet with logos, fonts colors, taglines, etc.
	-   Link to Style Sheet will be provided if requested.
	-   Any questions or concerns with style sheet or guidelines, drop into #design in the discord!
	-   Review proper uses of logo and examples of improper use
	-   Fonts matter!
	-   As a reminder, the style guide is a living document and can be updated as the brand changes & evolves.
	-   Streamer kit with transitions, backgrounds, camera overlays, motion backgrounds, etc. is available!
	-   More kits to come!
